# MySelfLearningReporsitory
Collection of files that i have worked on during my self learning path towards a successful data scientist.

# Contents
The repository is organized by language, with each language having its own folder. Within each folder, you will find a variety of files and projects that I have worked on. Some of these files may be incomplete or have errors, but I have included them to show my progress and learning process.

# Getting Started
To use the files in this repository, you will need to have the necessary software installed for each language. Here are some resources to help you get started:

- Python

- More to come!
